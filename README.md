This is a powerful locally hosted web based PDF manipulation tool using docker that allows you to perform various operations on PDF files, such as splitting merging, converting, reorganizing, adding images, rotating, compressing, and more. This locally hosted web application started as a 100% ChatGPT-made application and has evolved to include a wide range of features to handle all your PDF needs.

Stirling PDF makes no outbound calls for any record keeping or tracking.

All files and PDFs are either purely client side, in server memory only during the execution of the task or within a temporay file only for execution of the task.
Any file which has been downloaded by the user will have already been deleted from the server by that time.

## How to use

### Locally
Please view https://github.com/Frooodle/Stirling-PDF/blob/main/LocalRunGuide.md

### Docker / Podman
https://hub.docker.com/r/frooodle/s-pdf

Stirling PDF has 3 different versions, a Full version, Lite, and ultra-Lite. Depending on the types of features you use you may want a smaller image to save on space.
To see what the different versions offer please look at our [version mapping](https://github.com/Frooodle/Stirling-PDF/blob/main/Version-groups.md)
For people that don't mind about space optimization just use the latest tag.

## How to View
1. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`
2. Use the application by following the instructions on the website.


## Customisation
Stirling PDF allows easy customization of the app.
Includes things like
- Custom application name
- Custom slogans, icons, images, and even custom HTML (via file overrides)


There are two options for this, either using the generated settings file ``settings.yml``
This file is located in the ``/configs`` directory and follows standard YAML formatting

Environment variables are also supported and would override the settings file
For example in the settings.yml you have
```
system:
  defaultLocale: 'en-US'
```

To have this via an environment variable you would have ``SYSTEM_DEFAULTLOCALE``

The Current list of settings is
```
security:
  enableLogin: false # set to 'true' to enable login
  csrfDisabled: true

system:
  defaultLocale: 'en-US' # Set the default language (e.g. 'de-DE', 'fr-FR', etc)
  googlevisibility: false # 'true' to allow Google visibility (via robots.txt), 'false' to disallow
  customStaticFilePath: '/customFiles/static/' # Directory path for custom static files

#ui:
#  appName: exampleAppName # Application's visible name
#  homeDescription: I am a description # Short description or tagline shown on homepage.
#  appNameNavbar: navbarName # Name displayed on the navigation bar

endpoints:
  toRemove: [] # List endpoints to disable (e.g. ['img-to-pdf', 'remove-pages'])
  groupsToRemove: [] # List groups to disable (e.g. ['LibreOffice'])

metrics:
  enabled: true # 'true' to enable Info APIs endpoints (view http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/API to learn more), 'false' to disable
```
### Extra notes
- Endpoints. Currently, the endpoints ENDPOINTS_TO_REMOVE and GROUPS_TO_REMOVE can include comma separate lists of endpoints and groups to disable as example ENDPOINTS_TO_REMOVE=img-to-pdf,remove-pages would disable both image-to-pdf and remove pages, GROUPS_TO_REMOVE=LibreOffice Would disable all things that use LibreOffice. You can see a list of all endpoints and groups [here](https://github.com/Frooodle/Stirling-PDF/blob/main/Endpoint-groups.md) 
- customStaticFilePath. Customise static files such as the app logo by placing files in the /customFiles/static/ directory. An example of customising app logo is placing a /customFiles/static/favicon.svg to override current SVG. This can be used to change any images/icons/css/fonts/js etc in Stirling-PDF

### Environment only parameters
- ``SYSTEM_ROOTURIPATH`` ie set to ``/pdf-app`` to Set the application's root URI to ``localhost:8080/pdf-app``
- ``SYSTEM_CONNECTIONTIMEOUTMINUTES`` to set custom connection timeout values
- ``DOCKER_ENABLE_SECURITY`` to tell docker to download security jar (required as true for auth login)

## API
For those wanting to use Stirling-PDFs backend API to link with their own custom scripting to edit PDFs you can view all existing API documentation
[here](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/Frooodle/Stirling-PDF/) or navigate to /swagger-ui/index.html of your stirling-pdf instance for your versions documentation (Or by following the API button in your settings of Stirling-PDF)


## Login authentication
![stirling-login](images/login-light.png)
### Prerequisites: 
- User must have the folder ./configs volumed within docker so that it is retained during updates.
- Docker uses must download the security jar version by setting ``DOCKER_ENABLE_SECURITY`` to ``true`` in environment variables. 
- Then either enable login via the settings.yml file or via setting ``SECURITY_ENABLE_LOGIN`` to ``true``
- Now the initial user will be generated with username ``admin`` and password ``stirling``. On login you will be forced to change the password to a new one. You can also use the environment variables ``SECURITY_INITIALLOGIN_USERNAME`` and  ``SECURITY_INITIALLOGIN_PASSWORD`` to set your own straight away (Recommended to remove them after user creation).

Once the above has been done, on restart, a new stirling-pdf-DB.mv.db will show if everything worked.

When you login to Stirling PDF you will be redirected to /login page to login with those default credentials. After login everything should function as normal

To access your account settings go to Account settings in the settings cog menu (top right in navbar) This Account settings menu is also where you find your API key.

To add new users go to the bottom of Account settings and hit 'Admin Settings', here you can add new users. The different roles mentioned within this are for rate limiting. This is a Work in progress which will be expanding on more in future

For API usage you must provide a header with 'X-API-Key' and the associated API key for that user.


## FAQ

### Q1: What are your planned features?
- Progress bar/Tracking
- Full custom logic pipelines to combine multiple operations together.
- Folder support with auto scanning to perform operations on
- Redact text (Via UI not just automated way) 
- Add Forms
- Multi page layout (Stich PDF pages together) support x rows y columns and custom page sizing 
- Fill forms mannual and automatic 

### Q2: Why is my application downloading .htm files?
This is a issue caused commonly by your NGINX congifuration. The default file upload size for NGINX is 1MB, you need to add the following in your Nginx sites-available file. ``client_max_body_size SIZE;`` Where "SIZE" is 50M for example for 50MB files.

### Q3: Why is my download timing out
NGINX has timeout values by default so if you are running Stirling-PDF behind NGINX you may need to set a timeout value such as adding the config ``proxy_read_timeout 3600;``
